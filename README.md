# Python Based Fibre Simulator
In this repo I am implementing coherent multimode fibre simulations, making use of the GPU for rapid generation of fibre and signal realisations. This is designed to be imported as a separate python library using pip, and projects that make use of it can import it that way (rather than making a branch on top of it)


# Instructions
To run this code you will need to download pytorch, numpy, and scipy. This can be done by running pip install -r requirements.txt in the command line while within this directory. Examples of how to use this repository can be found in the main.py file.
